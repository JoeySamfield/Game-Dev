This game has two states. In the first state (state 0), you
dodge a bouncing ball of fire, jumping between a platform to
reach a star. Reaching the star increases your score, whereas
getting hit by the fire kills the player and sets the score to zero.

In the second stage, the player spawns in a hallway. There are
diamonds to pick up, each of which increases the score again.
At the end of the hallway is a star which functions just like the
one in the first stage. It also transports them back to the original
stage with the score intact.
